    - courses don't follow an hourly schedule
    - goal: take as many courses as possible
    - will need to fit all courses between some arbitrary start and end time
    - will need to leave at least 10 time units between courses
    - courses are represented as with two integers between 0 - 99 999, representing the start time and end time
    - scheduler class should be initialized with a classlist
    - scheduler class should have a function to calculate the max classes that can be taken
